#### Description

Wattpad is a rising new community of writers and readers of all age. Wattpad provides a whole new platform for the experienced and inexperienced writers to publish their work and get connected with the audience. Normally when a writer has new story which he wants to publish then he must get his work accepted by a literary agent, because the big publishers most of the time only takes submissions from literary agent. Sometimes literary agents do not understand the concept and reject their work, resulting author’s dream project converting into the disappointment.

Wattpad removes the middle man and introduces the writer’s content to the greater global audience allowing new talents to make their first step in the world of writing. With all the apps and websites out there in market, wattpad has the most diverse categories. Not only this wattpad also connects its users. The platform provides writers and readers to communicate with each other via messages. Wattpad also provides a star program for new talents in which if the story has reached enough popularity then they help author to publish the book. If you are not a writer and loves to read and wants to explore new author’s work, then wattpad is the right place to get started. Wattpad gives you recommendations based on your liking and previous reads. You can browse through the wide verity of categories and can read on your favorite topics. Wattpad provides feature to follow your favorite author, so that one can stay up to date with what they are reading and doing on wattpad. Apps gives you notification on whenever there is new post available on any of your reads. You can share, like and comment on any of your reads. With the help of this app new storytellers are coming out and getting recognized in the writer’s community. 

We can recognize this app as a book or magazine. This app uses the combination of messaging apps and reading apps technologies. 

App provides a great opportunity for rising writers as the app is very easy to use and to understand. And in addition, app is available on all platforms and for free & paid (removing ads). The weakness of this app is that, most of the writers are amateurs resulting for reader to find most of the time cliché plots and badly written stories. Because of that reader might lose their interest any leave. Furthermore, for the improvement, I would like to add an average reading time on every book and topic. So that every reader would figure out how much of their time will be consumed reading that book.


<span style="color:green">**First Heuristic Evaluation**: _Match between system and real world_</span>

As a book reading app this app uses the same genres as the library uses in the real world. The app provides you all the categories like Fiction, Adventure, Fantasy, Horror etc. Also, app provides some additional features like searching new stories by tags, where user can write anything after the tag and search all the categories and find the relevant topics. for example,
If a user searches for #computer then all the books which has a story or data related to computer will appear on your screen. In real world when user likes a book or wants to communicate with the author then user uses the medium of letter, message or an email, similarly here if the reader wants to communicate with the author then the chat is given, where reader can directly talk with the author.


<span style="color:green">**Second Heuristic Evaluation**: _User control and freedom_</span>

App provides new writers features to start writing their stories with pictures and if the story is published and writer wants to edit it afterwards then that can be done. So, at any point writer has full control over what is being published and how. At any moment if a reader accidently clicks on an ad and then he/she is being navigated to another window, after that also they can exit from that new window and can go back to the prevision stage where they left. Reader and author can follow each other and can check their activities, they can send each other messages and share their profiles to others too, also they can report and mute anyone from their followers list giving users full freedom and control.
