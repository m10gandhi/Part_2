In real world when user likes a book or wants to communicate with the author then user uses the medium of letter, message or an email, similarly here if the reader wants to communicate with the author then the chat is given, where reader can directly talk with the author.

App provides new writers features to start writing their stories with pictures and if the story is published and writer wants to edit it afterwards then that can be done. So, at any point writer has full control over what is being published and how. At any moment if a reader accidently clicks on an ad and then he/she is being navigated to another window, after that also they can exit from that new window and can go back to the prevision stage where they left. Reader and author can follow each other and can check their activities, they can send each other messages and share their profiles to others too, also they can report and mute anyone from their followers list giving users full freedom and control.
